# üéØ QuizApp

QuizApp is a ReactJS-based web application that allows users to take assessments by solving multiple-choice questions (MCQs). The application ensures a seamless user experience with validations, scoring, and a final result display.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Quiz**: Users can solve MCQs one question at a time.
- **Option Selection Validation**: Users cannot proceed to the next question without selecting an option.
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Scores are calculated in real-time using a `score` state variable.
- **Final Score Display**: Once all questions are answered, users are presented with their final score.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application provides a smooth and intuitive interface for taking quizzes.

## üöÄ How It Works

1. **Start the Quiz**:
   - The quiz begins with the first question displayed on the screen.
   
2. **Option Selection**:
   - Users must select an option to enable the "Next" button.
   - If no option is selected, the user cannot proceed to the next question.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The score is updated dynamically based on the correctness of the selected options.

4. **Final Score**:
   - Once the user completes all questions, the application displays the final score out of the total number of questions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **ReactJS**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **State Management**: Managed using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
